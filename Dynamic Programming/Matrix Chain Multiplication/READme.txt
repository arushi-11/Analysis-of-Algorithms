Matrix Chain Multiplication

In Matrix Chain Multiplication Problem we are given a number of matrices and 
is asked to multiply in such a way that the total number of scaler multiplication 
should be minimum by giving optimal parenthesis to the matrices.

eg.
we have,
Matrix A of order 5*4
Matrix B of order 4*3
Matrix C of order 3*5

Now two possible ways of multipling these matrices!
1. A*(B*C) = 5*4*3 + 5*3*5= 135 scalar multiplications.
2. A*(B*C) = 5*4*5 + 4*3*5 = 160 scalar multiplications.

So, option 1. gives best parenthesis to get minimun miltiplications.
